# CONVENTIONS — cft-anyons

Where the lab book defines *what* a term means, this file fixes *how* it is
represented: which gauge, which index base, which sign, which normalization.
**Law 2 (AGENTS.md): record a convention here before you rely on it.** This
subject is convention-dense; silent drift is the dominant source of
wrong-but-plausible results.

Changing an existing convention is a Core-tier change (AGENTS.md Rule 12): it
needs a sweep of every shard/file that follows it.

## Claim-status labels

Used throughout the lab book (referenced by CA-00). They are part of the record.

- **Question** — an open question; no commitment.
- **Proposal** — a hypothesis/construction proposed but not yet supported.
- **Source-local** — backed by a cited local source (`references/...:line`).
- **Checked** — backed by a passing test, derivation, or reproducible run.
- **Rejected** — tried and found wrong; kept so it is not re-attempted.

## Schema for each convention entry

```
## (<letter>) <name>
**Choice:** <the canonical decision>      (or: NOT YET FIXED — fix at first use)
**Reasoning:** <why; what was rejected; relevant hallucination-risk callout>
**Source:** <references/...:line | report shard ID | external ref>
**Sweep status:** <which shards/files follow this; outliers flagged>
```

## Convention slots (to be fixed at first use)

These are the known convention-sensitive choices (AGENTS.md
"Convention-sensitivity"). Each is **NOT YET FIXED** — the first shard that needs
it must fix it here, with a source, in the same change. The archived
`archive/legacy-consolidation/CONVENTIONS.md` worked several of these out in
detail and is useful as *reference prior art* (dead, not canonical — re-derive
and re-cite).

## (a) Vacuum / unit-object index
**Choice:** NOT YET FIXED.
**Reasoning:** 0-indexed vs 1-indexed enumerations of `Irr(C)` were a recurring
bug in prior work; fix once and cite.
**Source:** —
**Sweep status:** —

## (b) F-symbol / R-symbol gauge
**Choice:** NOT YET FIXED.
**Reasoning:** unitary vs involutory gauge differ; importing entries across
gauges gives silently-wrong inner products (TensorCategories.jl is involutory).
**Source:** —
**Sweep status:** —

## (c) Fusion-tree bracketing and label order
**Choice:** NOT YET FIXED.
**Reasoning:** left- vs right-associated trees relate by an F-move; entries must
be stated in one convention.
**Source:** —
**Sweep status:** —

## (d) CFT normalizations
**Choice:** NOT YET FIXED.
**Reasoning:** central charge, Virasoro mode convention, OPE-coefficient
normalization, chiral vs full — record before use.
**Source:** —
**Sweep status:** —

## (e) Lattice conventions
**Choice:** NOT YET FIXED.
**Reasoning:** Hamiltonian sign, orientation, boundary type, star/plaquette
naming.
